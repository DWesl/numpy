Removal of deprecated `trapz` function, `disp` method, and `bias`/`ddof` args in `corrcoef`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following long-deprecated APIs have been removed:

* ``numpy.trapz`` — deprecated since NumPy 2.0 (2023-08-18). Use ``numpy.trapezoid`` or
  ``scipy.integrate`` functions instead.
* ``disp`` method — deprecated in earlier releases and no longer functional. Use your own printing function instead.
* ``bias`` and ``ddof`` arguments in ``numpy.corrcoef`` — these had no effect since NumPy 1.10.

Associated tests and type stubs have been updated or removed accordingly.
